Activities performed:

We created a git hook that would automatically run bandit when a user commits. 
This also saved the bandit output to a csv file automatically, namely banditOutput.csv.

The team implemented fuzzing by making a new file (fuzz.py) that fuzzed five different python methods.
The output of this is saved to fuzzOutput.txt.

Finally, we implemented software forensics into five different python methods.
We did this through adding logging in different methods of different python files.
The logging is saved to SIMPLE-LOGGER.log.

Lessons Learned:

We learned about working with, managing, and coordinating a team to complete work.

We learned multiple different methods to analyze and find issues with source code.

We learned about software security and taking steps to keep our code safe.

We learned about using static analysis to test our code through Git hooks, and how to save these results to a comprehensive document.

We learned about how to analyze code and methods to determine effective fuzzing procedures and values that will reveal errors and vulnerabilities in the code.

We also learned about using simple loggers to easily create a log that is comprehensive to developers and much faster than carrying out tedious, line-by-line debugging.
